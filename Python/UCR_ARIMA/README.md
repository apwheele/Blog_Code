# ARIMA forecasts for US Violent Crime Rates

Response piece to Richard Rosenfeld's article in the [Criminologist](https://asc41.org/wp-content/uploads/ASC-Criminologist-2023-11.pdf) (Nov/Dec 2023).

I grabbed the historical [UCR from this website](https://www.disastercenter.com/crime/uscrime.htm) for 1960 through 2019. It looks correct, but caveat emptor (if you know a more official source let me know!).

For the 2020-2022 rates, I used the [FBI data explorer API](https://cde.ucr.cjis.gov/LATEST/webapp/#/pages/docApi).
