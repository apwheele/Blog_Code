# Memphis Hot Spots

I created this example to show how hot spots of crime in Memphis are not where Nichols was pulled over. Partly in response [to this WSJ article](https://www.wsj.com/articles/tyre-nichols-case-prompts-questions-about-police-tactics-in-crime-hot-spots-11675311579) that suggests what Memphis was doing was hot spots policing.
