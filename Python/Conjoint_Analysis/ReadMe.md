This is an example conjoint analysis of a subset of data for the really old national crime victimization survey in which folks were asked to rank crimes.

The `Parse_Data.py` file parses the [original data files from ICPSR](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/NACJD/studies/8295/datadocumentation) into a nicer, flat format `NSCS_Supplement.csv`. I then do analysis in the Jupyter notebook on this csv file.

I've also included the Codebook for the original data, as well as the ICPSR info on proper citation.

If you have any questions, always feel free to email.
